    "- - [ ] There is a significant decrease in the over all passing % for larger schools compared to smaller schools. Larger schools are almost have the over all passing percentage compared to medium and small schools. These larger schools are mainly district schools. These district schools often have the higher spending ranges per student compared to the Charter schools. Although they may have higher spending per student the way the resources are allocated may not be similar to those of Charter schools who are able to reach these higher passing percentages. The data shows the changes in student math and reading scores based on school size, budget, and type of school. \n",
